# JetsProject
This Project allows a user to choose an option from a menu, and see all the different kinds of jets in an air field. It also breaks down which jet is a fighter jet and which jet would be a bomber jet, or cargo jet. The user can also add or remove jets from this air field.
# Description
This Jets Project is designed to display information pertaining to Jets. It shows them the model, speed, range, and the price of the given jets. It also allows them to create their own jets with the same parameters, or to remove an existing jet from the air field which hold all the information pertaining to the jets. This project uses abstract classes, as well as interfaces. I have created a user menu which will allow the user to chose through the options and to also take in user input and use it. The menu has the options to show all the jets in the air field, or to find the fastest jet and display that to the user, or even to find the jet with the longest range in the air field and also display that to the user. 
# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse
# Lessons Learned
I learned how to add and remove jets from an array list, and how to use abstract classes as well as interfaces. On top of that, I learned the differences of abstract classes and interfaces.
